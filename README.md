## **Overview**
This project is a simple **Command Line Interface (CLI) To-Do List** built using Python. It allows users to:
- **Add tasks** to the list
- **Delete tasks** from the list
- **Mark tasks as completed ✅**
- **View current tasks**
- **Exit the program**

Tasks are stored dynamically during execution, and completed tasks are visually marked.

## **Prerequisites**
Ensure you have:
- **Python 3.x** installed

## **Installation**

   - `4. Task Completed` → Mark a task as completed ✅  
   - `5. Exit` → Close the program

## **Features**
- **Tasks are stored dynamically in a list**

- **Tasks can be deleted and updated easily**

## **Future Enhancements**
